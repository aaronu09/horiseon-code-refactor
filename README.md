## Description
- What was your motivation?
In terms of ethics, by making the website more accessible, it means that people with disabilities are able to access it more easily through assistive technologies.

- Why did you build this project? 
In terms of businesses, a more accessible website allows the website to be better positioned in search engines as well as avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access the website.

- What problem does it solve?
The user story describes a problem in which a marketing agency want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their own site is optimised for search engines. However, the code that was presented was not in the most accessible state. Therefore, the problem to solve was to refactor the code in a way that make the website more accessible.

- What did you learn?
In doing this project, I learned the value of accessibility in terms of both ethics and business; the value of avoiding div's can't be emphasised enough to help with accessibility. I've also learned about Scout Rule in which where possible, the coder should leave the code a little cleaner than when it was found.
## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
1)Change all the divs into other HTML semantic elements: header, nav, section, img, aside
2)Change the header section in the css to be nav instead of div so that it matches the html
3)Add more meta terms to improve accessibility: description, keywords, author, viewport, stylesheet
4)Name the website something in the title element (something that isn't "Website")
5)Remove any deadcode under Scout Rule (make the code cleaner)
